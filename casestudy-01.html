            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            <p>How can the City of Munich enhance their tourist services by introducing a robotic interface for city
                tours that adapts to their tourists' diverse needs and does not interfere with the cityscape?</p>
        </div>

        <h4>The Process</h4>
        <p class="process-description">After evaluating requirements and user needs, we developed a concept for a
            robotic interface resulting in a video prototype as deliverable. The process we followed can be structured
            into four discrete steps: Discovery, Define, Ideate, and Hand-off.</p>

                <p>Using moodboards we explored the cityscape of munich with its various sights and buildings. We wanted
                    our robotic interface to reflect the visual identity of munich including the bright fronts of the
                    architecture and the
                    bronze material of the sculptures. Since the city offers many parks and green spaces, we explored
                    more organic forms to complement these traits. Our robotic interface might also be used by children,
                    so we took inspiration of steering wheels, playgrounds and pretzels to apply an affordance for them
                    to interact
                    with the robot in a playful and exploring way.</p>

                    that needs flexibility and carefulness, and an elementary student that demands fun and
                    entertainment.</p>

                    Furthermore, we defined the condition that the sightseeing experiences for both the adults and
                    children should be possible to take place at the same time without interfering.</p>

                    problems and features. For the material we used a Miro board and for the communication a Zoom call.
                    We invited six individuals - four actually joined the call. The agenda started with a short warm-up,
                    followed by a role play, where the participants took over the role of the personas we defined
                    earlier. After that, they discussed several feature and design ideas and were invited to give their
                    very own imagination of a robot cityguide. The session was documented using written record.</p>

                <p>Afterwards, we systematically analysed the insights of the focus group and derived key take aways on
                    which we based our further work. These included the visual design of the robot, interaction
                    concepts, and general feature decisions. For example: The participants saw the requirement for a
                    seating, but asked for a minimalistic concept, as they didn't want it to look like the main feature.
                    On the other hand, they really liked the charging feature and described it as a useful feature for
                    long trips and also proposed to integrate a WiFi hotspot.</p>

                    robot head that serves as attention signal and projector for navigation symbols on the floor while
                    it offers a small space for baggage.</p>

                    what interaction paradigm would fit such a citytour context (visual signals vs. voice vs. app

                <p>During the tour, the screen shows visual insights and navigation hints by showing a map and
                    indicators. The robot includes headphones but can also be used with privat bluetooth headphones. The
                    voice guide presents the information on the screen auditory so that the tour group can enjoy the
                    sightseeing without staring at the screen.</p>
                <img src="images/case-studies/cityguide/Gruppe 14.png" alt="">
                <p>As additional features, the robot contains two shelves. A small shelf directly under the screen with
                    four charging slots for phones and one bigger shelf to store luggage.</p>

                <p>As already mentioned, the large touchscreen on the front shows visual information crucial for
                    navigating in the city and complements the auditory information of the sightseeing. It is also used
                    to communicate with the tourist group and to advertise the citytour when not in use.</p>
                <img src="images/case-studies/cityguide/videoprototype02.png" alt="">
                <p>The UI on the screen and the physical buttons (below the screen, on the shelves, and on the lower end
                    of the seat) use a warm and easy to understand visual language with big
                    icons and short text. The GUI color theme is based on the colors we explored in our munich
                    moodboard.

                Game Design
            </h5>
            <div class="casestudy-section-image">
                <p>The gamified part of the robot tourguide takes place on the steering wheel. It includes a screen in
                    the center, a tangible interface with the two grips left and right, as well as a small camera on the
                    back for the AR features. The whole experience is structured based on the sightseeing spots. Each
                    sightseeing spot represents one part of the interactive experience, that the children can join
                    casually. Each part features a story mode and a game mode. </p>
                <p>The story mode presents the current sight and combines information with narration. It guides the
                    child with AR elements that overlap with the physical sight to narrate a certain legend or to teach
                    the child about interesting facts regarding that place. The aim of this mode is to let the child
                    explore the sight in a playful way and to awaken their inner explorer.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The game mode invites the child to search for pretzel coins that are hidden around the sight. The AR
                    pretzel coins can be found by panning and tilting the steering wheel with the handles. The screen
                    serves as a sight pipe. When the child aims and holds on a target with the steering wheel screen it
                    will be collected. When they've collected all hidden coins at the current sight, they win the game
                    for this sightseeing stop.</p>

            <div class="casestudy-section-image">
                <p>One part of our final deliverable is a video prototype of our concept. For the production we prepared
                    various equipment including cameras, a greenscreen, props, a lo-fi prototype of the final steering
                    wheel design, a shotlist, and a production plan. Our video prototype starred a family of three: Two
                    of our group
                    were casted as parents and we asked a befriended couple's daughter to act as the daugther of the
                    fictional family.</p>
                <img src="images/case-studies/cityguide/DW2-Drehplan-01.JPG" alt="">
                <p> The production took place one day at three preselected locations in munich. At Stachus, we showcased the
                    first encounter with the robot, the navigation feature, and the two add-on features (luggage,
                    charging). At the big church Frauenkirche we presented the audio guide and the game experience.
                    Finally at the last location (planned: Odeonsplatz, changed to: Marienplatz), we produced a final
                    scene with the group taking a break and the end of the citytour.</p>

                <p>The robot model was constructed as an animated 3D model in Blender with UI elements created with
                    Adobe XD. The animated model of the robot and the video footage were combined using AfterEffects and
                    partly greenscreen. The final video was edited using Premiere Pro.</p>

                <p>The final video prototype shows the fictional family Martin that arrives a the Stachus station and
                    wants to take a tour with our robot cityguide. After the mother scanning the QR Code on the screen,
                    the father stores his backpack in the luggage shelf and puts his phone in the charging shelf. The
                    robot navigates them to the sight Frauenkirche, where the parents are looking at the church while
                    listening to the audio guide and their daughter following the story mode and playing the game mode.
                    The story mode features information about the towers of the church and the famous legend of the
                    devil's footprint in the entrance area of the church. In the game mode, she collects flying pretzels
                    around the church while sitting on the seat. The last scenes show the family taking a break after
                    pushing the robot's "take a break" button and the robot saying goodbye after the final sight.</p>

        <h4>My Take-Aways</h4>
            <ul class="casestudy-takeaways">
                <li>Hardware design extends software design by multiple aspects, including haptic feedback, material, measurements, and alternative GUI presentations. And minding their interplay is crucial for a well-designed experience.</li>
                <li>The design of this robot-prototype will take several more iteration and working together with electro engineers, software developers and mechanics to achieve a first fully functional version.</li>
                <li>Working in a team not only requires good communication, but also letting each other thrive in what we are already capable of while challenging each other to take over tasks we've never done before.</li>
                <li>The designer ≠ the user - Involving user feedback from the beginning is crucial for not forgetting why we are even designing a product.</li>
